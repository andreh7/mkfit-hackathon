# Fitting Test

This is derived from bits and pieces of the mictest project with all the non-GPU  bits stripped out.  Requires setup similar to multorture plus

```
    export CUBROOT=${CUB_ROOT}/include
```

Multiple threads certainly won't work; to increase the workload, increase the number of tracks simulated.
